The scripts and files used in "Widespread adaptive introgression of MHC genes across
vertebrate hybrid zones" (Gaczorek et al., 2024) article.

The repository includes:  
1. START_HERE.html - html document including the R code used for comparative analyses of hybrid zones. I highly encourage to start exploring this repository from this file. Note that you can also find "START_HERE.qmd" file which might be more useful if you want to rerun some code.  
2. genotypes/ -  MHC genotypes for each taxon  
3. genetic_info/ - genome-wide estimates of admixture for each taxon  
4. localities/ - information about samples localization for each taxon    
5. permutations/ - results of randomization tests. It also includes the species tree in the newick format.  
6. geographic_clines/ - results of geographical cline fitting for each taxon  
7. genomic_clines/ - results of genomic cline fitting for each taxon  
8. temp_tables/ - tables generated by START_HERE script. I included them to make it possible to run only specific sections of above-mentioned script.  
9. Solea_example/ - script and data showing the analysis of a specific hybrid zone.  
10. additional_scripts/ - few external scripts used during the analysis of individual hybrid zones  
11. SLIM_simulation/ - SLIM and R scripts used for running the simulation included in the article
